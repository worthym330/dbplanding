            <p>
              Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information,
              which are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer or
              smartphone) when you visit a website. Cookies can be recognized by
              the website that downloaded them — or other websites that use the
              same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has
              visited them before.

              PIXEL TAGS AND WEB BEACONS
            </h2>
            <p>
              Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images and small blocks
              of code placed on website pages, ads, or in our emails that allow us
              to determine whether you performed a specific action. When you
              access these pages, or when you open an email, the pixel tags and
              web beacons let us know you have accessed the web page or opened the
              email. These tools help us measure response to our communications
              and improve our web pages and promotions.

              HOW WE USE COOKIES
            </h2>
            <p>
              Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how
              the DayBreakPass platform is being used, letting you navigate
              between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and
              generally improving your browsing experience. Cookies can also help
              ensure marketing you see online is more relevant to you and your
              interests.

              TYPES OF COOKIES WE USE
            </h2>
            <p>
              When you visit our websites we place cookies on your computer.
              Cookies are small text files that websites send to your computer or
              other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify your browser or
              to store information or settings in your browser. Cookies allow us
              to recognize you when you return. They also help us provide a
              customized experience and can enable us to detect certain kinds of
              fraud.

                essential, as they enable you to move around the DayBreakPass
                platform and use its features, such as accessing secure areas.
                Without these cookies, some services you have asked for such as

                information about how you use the DayBreakPass platform, for
                example which pages you go to most often and if you get error
                messages from certain pages. These cookies don’t gather
                information that identifies you. All information these cookies

              FIRST AND THIRD PARTY COOKIES
            </h2>
            <p>
              First party cookies are cookies that belong to us, while third party
              cookies are cookies that another party places on your browsing
              device through our DayBreakPass platform. For example, Facebook will
              place a cookie on your browsing device if you click on the Facebook
              link when browsing the DayBreakPass platform.

              HOW LONG WILL COOKIES STAY ON MY BROWSING DEVICE
            </h2>
            <p>
              The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device
              depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session
              cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing.
              Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or
              are deleted.
